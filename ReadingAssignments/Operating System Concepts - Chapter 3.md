## Concept
### The Process
- The process is a program in execution
- The memory layout of a process is typically divided into multiple sections:
  - Text section
  - Data section
  - Heap section
  - Stack section
- The sizes of the text and data sections are fixed. The stack and heap sections can shrink and grow dynamically during program execution.
