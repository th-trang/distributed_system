# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1. Network, Packets and Protocols
- A computer network consists of machines interconnected by communication. Those machines are *hosts* and *routers* 
  - **Hosts** are computer that run applications. The application programs running on hosts are thr real "users" of the network.
  - **Routers** are machines whose job is to relay (or forward) *information* from 1 communication channel to another.
  - **A Communication channel** is a means of conveying sequences of bytes from one host to another, may be wired (Ethernet), may be wireless (Wifi) or other connections.
  - **Information**: sequences of bytes that are constructed and interpreted by programs.
    - Those sequences, in the context of computer networks, are generally called *packets*.
      - Packets contains control info and sometimes includes user data. Routers use control info to figure our how to forward each packet.
  - **Protocol**: an agreement about the packets exchanged by communicating programs and what they mean
    - Tells how packets are structured (ex: where the dest info is located in the packet, how big and how to interprete those info).
    - Is designed to solve a specific prob using given capabilities.
- **TCP/IP**: a collection of protocols
